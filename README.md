This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data.

Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.
